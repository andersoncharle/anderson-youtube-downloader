## Anderson-yt-dlp.sh

A Bash script for downloading YouTube videos using the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) command-line tool. This script is designed to download either a single video or an entire playlist from YouTube.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script directly.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x anderson-yt-dlp.sh`
3. Run the script: `./anderson-yt-dlp.sh`

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the URL of the YouTube video or playlist you want to download. The script will then use yt-dlp to download the video or playlist in the best quality available.

If the download is successful, the script will output "Download completed successfully on [DATE]" to the console. If the download fails, the script will output "Download failed. please check error.log" and save the error message to a file named error.log.

By default, the script downloads videos in the mp4 format with the best quality video and audio available. You can customize the format and quality of the download by modifying the `-f` flag in the script.

### Examples

Download a single video:

` $ ./anderson-yt-dlp.sh`

 Enter the YouTube URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefg) 

Download an entire playlist:

`$ ./anderson-yt-dlp.sh`

 Enter the YouTube URL: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=abcdefg](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=abcdefg)
